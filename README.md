# AutoMapper

The AutoMapper solves a simple problem: removing all the code you need to map one object to another. A boring code to 
write and often replaced by less-performant alternatives like Symfony's Serializer.
## Quick Start 🚀

```shell
composer require jolicode/automapper
```

You can read more about this library and how to use it on the [documentation](https://jolicode.github.io/automapper/).
